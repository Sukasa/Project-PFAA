CHANGES:

* This is an update to the unreleased GitHub fan version
* Amadron tablet removed
* OpenComputers transistors take less plastic to produce
* Added missing dyed wool / painter recipes using lime paint
* IE cables were adjusted to reduce false burns, and to ease HV transmission
* Some lime paints can now be produced in the IHL chemical reactor
* TechGuns will no longer mess with the FOV when sprinting
* Some dense plates can now be automated
* Creeper Acid re-added
* Obsidian can be made in the AR Chemical Reactor
* Electric trains de-nerfed
* 2x2 Half Framed Drawers will now consume saw durability and not the saw
* OpenComputers updated, Computronics added
* Metal casings can be made in the Metal Press
* Some guide documentation has been updated and expanded
* TFC Support Beams can now be produced in the Carpenter
* TFC Lapis no longer voided by IE Crusher
* Nuclear Control mod volumes fixed, new howler alarm sounds added
* All Chisel mod blocks should now be attainable in survival
* Project:Red insulated cables now require rubber, but use less red alloy
* Changed recipe for Project:Red insulated cables to improve dye efficiency
* Railcraft Tank valves and gauges can now be produced in the PneumaticCraft assembly station at a higher input efficiency
* Chunk loading was tweaked for large bases and train networks
* Quests updated to include hint quests for new and existing content, and to not overlap with UI elements
* TechGuns oil clusters buffed to make automated/permanent oil wells slightly more practical
* FoamFix 1.7.10 has been added, with Log4J exploit mitigations
* Colourized some petrochem products to ease identification
* TechGuns' volumes adjusted to be in line with other game audio

KNOWN ISSUES:

* TFC Anvils can passively consume up to 1 ms/tick per anvil on their own, if placed in the world
* AR multiblocks do not always update properly without a block update to their controller block.  For example, filling the solids input and then the fluid input on a chemical reactor will not start the reaction.
* RailCraft Locomotive Detectors do not support any dyes other than the vanilla dyes
* Electric locomotives cannot be dyed
* Project Red IC Gates are buggy.  They cannot self-start after a chunk loads (if they have timers or oscillators internally), and any timers or state cells which share exact timings will operate incorrectly
* Trying to create an IC gate via the creative menu will crash the game.  Craft it using the survival recipe: 8 circuit plates surrounding the fabricated IC
