§2§lIHL wire and the electrolysis bath

§C§LNote: The usage of IHL wires is completely optional! Since the IHL electrolysis bath is no longer used to make aluminium, magnesium, etc., you do not need to use it anymore. If for whatever reason you still choose to use IHL wires, read the following info.

The electrolysis bath can only be connected to IC2 grids via IHL cables. To use the wire, sneak-right click the electrolysis bath then sneak-right click an IC2 power source (storage block or wires).
§C§LWARNING: There is an unknown bug which could lead to server deadlock when using IE wires with IHL wires. If you really want to use IE wires to power it, the connection sequence should be IE->IC2->IC2->IHL instead of IE->IC2->IHL, as shown below.
