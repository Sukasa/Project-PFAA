§2§lBugs and performance

There have been a couple of bugs that are currently unfixable.
- DO NOT CRAFT MICROBLOCKS IN CREATIVE MODE. This will corrupt your world.
- When using Techguns explosive charges, do not open the gui in mid-air. Put it down, wait a couple of seconds before opening the GUI.
- Same for the particle accelerator GUI, don't open it in mid-air.
- Do not press F3 in places other than the overworld.
- IHL wires needs to be used properly to prevent a potential deadlock (see Chapter 3, Section 4).
- Sometimes Railcraft locomotives with an anchor cart will get stuck on their journey. If that happens, try to use booster tracks instead.

ALWAYS USE DEDICATED PIPES FOR EACH OF YOUR FLUIDS.
During the test run period it was discovered that a fluid network with either IE fluid pipes or high pressure pipes with multiple fluids sharing the same pipeline will cause serious performance issues, especially with a large network. 

Also, the TFC anvil eats a lot of tick time even while sitting idle. You might want to put it inside a chest when not using it.

The number of machines present in your base might cause a large FPS drop towards the endgame. If you don't have a good rig, I'd recommend planning your base horizontally instead of vertically and setting a lower view distance.
