§2§lParticle accelerator - mechanisms

§3§lDrag force
After placing the core block, it will start to scan the block behind it and save the location of each connected tunnel block.
An average value of all core block positions will be calculated, giving the "center" of the accelerator. The average distance from each core block to the "center" is then calculated, giving the radius of the accelerator R. The standard deviation of this average distance is then calculated as S, which represents the "roundness" of the accelerator.

The "drag force" d is calculated as:
§C§ld = S * 1000 / R / ( N ^ 2 ) + kDrag
Where N is the number of tunnel blocks, kDrag is a constant defined in the config file.

TL;DR: Making your accelerator round and increasing its radius will both reduce the drag.


§3§lFail rate
The fail rate is defined by:
§C§lrf = R ^ 2 * kFail
Where kFail is a constant defined in the config file. The bigger your ring, the easier it will fail.

The fail rate can be reduced with each stabilizer:
§C§lrf' = rf * kStablizer - 0.01
Where kStablizer is a constant in the config file.

§3§lAcceleration rate calculation
The acceleration rate is calculated by:
§C§la = kOverall * (kAcceleration * sqrt(I) * (random() > rf ? 1 : 0 ) - d)
Where kOverall and kAcceleration are constants in the config file, and I is the total EU/t provided to the machine.
When a reaches 100, the progress will reset and 1mB of UUM will be generated.
There is a square root on the current, which means the higher the current, the lower the efficiency. However, if the current is too low, the efficiency will also decrease due to the presence of the drag force. This means, for each specific setup, there is an optimum current. You need to discover it by calculation or experimentation.
