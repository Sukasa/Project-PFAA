Assuming that you have obtained enough titanium, certus quartz and all 4 presses from AE2, it's time to reinforce your industry, mainly in energy production.

You can now build gas turbines from the Advanced Generators mod, which burn all liquid fuels with a much higher efficiency. Be sure to use the Fuel/Air Mixer and the Gas Mix Compressor!

The syngas producer can create syngas from solid fuels, which can boost your hydrogen production and increase the general yield of oil/gas processing.

If you found a pitchblende ore cluster and want some IC2 fission power, make sure to use the fluid reactor. The simple one has a very low efficiency while the output of the fluid reactor has been boosted. The AG heat exchanger can be used with the fluid reactor with a higher heat-to-energy ratio. It also prevents your reactor from blowing up when the server lags.

AE2 can be started now, but note that the power usage has been increased by 10 times, so you might want to limit it to item storage for the moment.

Having your power grid augmented, it's time for another challenge: UU matter production
