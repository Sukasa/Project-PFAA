§2§lParticle accelerator - the basics

To make UUM production more interesting, we have created this particle accelerator mod specifically for this pack.
This mod was inspired by the atomic science mod in 1.4.7, but was written in a much more performance-friendly way.

The accelerator needs to be built best with a round shape, so the first thing you want to make is an accelerator building instructor.
This block doesn't do anything alone, but if you place certain blocks on it, it will show a circle with a specific radius. 
Gold Block=10, Iron Block=5, Cobblestone=2, Oak Plank=1. Blocks can be stacked as shown below:

Cover the line with accelerator hull blocks like below, it should form a circle and cover the line completely:
{"image":"acc1.png"}
{"image":"acc2.png"}

Then, place a layer of accelerator tunnel blocks over the hull blocks:
{"image":"acc3.png"}

Now, cover every side of the tunnel blocks with hull blocks, you should get something like this:
{"image":"acc4.png"}

Replace any 2 hull blocks with an accelerator energy port and fluid port:
{"image":"acc5.png"}
{"image":"acc6.png"}

And a hull block with the accelerator core:
{"image":"acc7.png"}

Right-click to open the GUI and it will start to scan the structure. This will take some time so be patient:
{"image":"acc8.png"}

When scanning is finished, the GUI will look like this:
{"image":"acc9.png"}

Power it up and start producing UUM, which can be pumped out from the fluid port:
{"image":"acc10.png"}
{"image":"acc11.png"}

I'd recommend starting with an accelerator with a radius of 7-10 blocks. If you want, the accelerator can be built with any shape you like, but it will work at a lower efficency.

The accelerator does not have a fixed power usage and will use all provided energy to work. The bigger the current, the faster it will go. If the completion percentage doesn't move, try to provide it with a higher current. The energy usage per UUM depends on the size of the accelerator. Generally, the bigger the circle, the better the efficiency. The exact mechanism is explained in the following sections.

An array of MFSUs will be necessary to provide the current in the beginning. Design your power system wisely.
