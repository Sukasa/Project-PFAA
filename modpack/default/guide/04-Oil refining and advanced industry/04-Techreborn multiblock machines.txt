§2§lTechReborn multiblock machines

TechReborn tries to replicate the old gregtech 2. Due to the lack of information of the old age, the usage of multiblock machines is presented here.
All TR multiblock machines are formed by standard/reinforced/advanced machine casings and a controller block.

§C§LWarning: Due to TR bugs, all machines only accept a maximum voltage of 32 EU/packet (LV), use transformer arrays if you want to provide them with enough power.

§3§lIndustrial blast furnace
The most fundamental device of this mod, the hull can be made with all 3 type of casings, where increasing the casing tier will increase its maximum temperature (i.e. smelting silicon will need a couple of advanced casings). The block placement is as follows.

§3§lIndustrial grinder
A built-in grinder + washer.

Note: if you play thaumcraft, do not put this machine in the range of arcane lamps. The grinder does not like a light source generated in its center.

§3§lImplosion compressor
You need this to make iridium plates.
